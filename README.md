Hi!

## What does Aram do?

Hi, I'm a Software Development Manager for Ad Tech at The Washington Post. I previously built the Privacy and Security Compliance team and worked on the Zeus SaaS team, helping publishers to maximize site performance and revenue. I've also worked on Washington Post R&D and Big Data teams. Aram has developed open-source tools for publishers and consulted on content strategy and digital newsroom workflows. He was one of Folio Magazine‚Äôs 15 under 30 in the magazine media industry.
